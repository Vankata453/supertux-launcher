# SuperTux Launcher

SuperTux Launcher is a SuperTux fan-made application, which allows players to install, launch and manage many different SuperTux versions on one (currently only 
Windows) device.

It aims to allow playing older, as well as newer releases of the game simultaneously on one device and remove the need for reinstalling the game, when wanting to play another version.

If you want to use SuperTux Launcher and/or help testing it, feel free to do so by downloading the latest experimental release from the "Releases" tab!

## Installing

You can run the program from source, or go to the "Releases" tab and download it directly (currently only for Windows) from there. Keep in mind this program 
**doesn't come with any warranty**, so **download it at your own risk!**

You may also want to run the program directly from source. Follow the instructions below if you need help doing so with `npm`.

* [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) - the main module the launcher is mostly built on.

* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - used to help with modern front-end appearance in various ways.

* [wget-improved](https://github.com/bearjaws/node-wget) - used for GitHub download requests, since they use redirects.

despite them not actually connecting you to the internet.

### Creating installers
